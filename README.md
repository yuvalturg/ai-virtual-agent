# AI Virtual Assistant

A comprehensive platform for creating and managing AI-powered virtual assistants with knowledge base integration, built on top of LlamaStack.

## Overview

The AI Virtual Assistant platform provides a complete solution for building intelligent conversational agents that can access and reason over your organization's knowledge. The system combines modern web technologies with powerful AI capabilities to deliver a seamless experience for both developers and end users.

### Key Features

- **🤖 Virtual Agent Management**: Create, configure, and manage AI agents with different personalities and capabilities
- **📚 Knowledge Base Integration**: Upload documents and create searchable knowledge bases for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
- **💬 Real-time Chat**: Stream-based chat interface with Server-Sent Events for responsive conversations
- **🔧 Tool Integration**: Support for built-in tools (RAG, web search) and external MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers
- **🛡️ Safety & Guardrails**: Configurable input/output shields and safety measures
- **📊 Session Management**: Persistent chat sessions with history and metadata
- **🏗️ Scalable Architecture**: Production-ready deployment with Kubernetes and containerization

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + PatternFly UI + TanStack Router/Query
- **Backend**: FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + PostgreSQL + Alembic
- **AI Platform**: LlamaStack for agent management and inference
- **Vector Storage**: pgvector for knowledge base embeddings
- **Document Processing**: Kubeflow Pipelines + Docling for ingestion
- **Infrastructure**: Kubernetes + Helm + MinIO for object storage

## Architecture

The platform consists of several interconnected components:

- **Frontend UI**: Modern React application for user interaction
- **Backend API**: FastAPI server handling business logic and data persistence
- **LlamaStack**: AI platform managing agents, models, and inference
- **Knowledge Processing**: Kubernetes-based document ingestion pipeline
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with vector extension for data storage

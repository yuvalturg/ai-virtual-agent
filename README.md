# AI Virtual Agent

A comprehensive platform for creating and managing AI-powered virtual agents with knowledge base integration, built on top of LlamaStack.Use this to quickly create AI Virtual Agent for different user personas such as lawyer, accountants and marketers.

To see how it's done, refer to the [installation guide](INSTALLING.md).

## Description

The AI Virtual Agent platform provides a complete solution for building intelligent conversational agents that can access and reason over your organization's knowledge. The system combines modern web technologies with powerful AI capabilities to deliver a seamless experience for both developers and end users.

### Use Cases

- **Customer Support**: Create AI agents with access to product documentation and FAQ databases
- **Internal Knowledge Management**: Build intelligent agents for employee onboarding and information access
- **Document Q&A**: Enable natural language queries over large document collections
- **Multi-modal Assistance**: Combine different AI capabilities through tool integration

## Architecture

The platform consists of several interconnected components:

- **Frontend UI**: Modern React application for user interaction
- **Backend API**: FastAPI server handling business logic and data persistence
- **LlamaStack**: AI platform managing agents, models, and inference
- **Knowledge Processing**: Kubernetes-based document ingestion pipeline
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL with vector extension for data storage
